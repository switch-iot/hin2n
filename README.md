N2N is a VPN project that supports p2p. It was originally developed and open sourced by `Luca Deri` <deri@ntop.org>, `Richard Andrews` <andrews@ntop.org> of ntop.org, and `Meyerd` <https://github.com/meyerd> continues to do optimization work. Our goal is to provide `mobile version` support.

The original n2n supports many platforms, including windows, linux, osx, bsd, openwrt, raspberry pie, etc., except for mobile phones(non-root). Therefore, we have developed the Hin2n project.

### What is Hin2n
- Hin2n is a mobile VPN app that supports the n2n protocol
- Hin2n does not need a rooted phone
- Hin2n only supports Android phones for now, IPhone version will be developed in the future
- Hin2n is currently in continuous development and will gradually provide more complete versions
- Hin2n now supports all v1/v2/v2s protocols

### Hin2n latest version [CHANGELOG](Hin2n_android/CHANGELOG)
The latest version of Hin2n is available for download at [release link](https://github.com/switch-iot/hin2n/releases).

### Hin2n Development Plan
View the development plan at [`Projects`](https://github.com/switch-iot/hin2n/projects).
If you have new features and ideas, you can submit them in [`issues`](https://github.com/switch-iot/hin2n/issues), and we will arrange development plans as appropriate. Your concern is our motivation.

### Technical principle
- VPNService
> Hin2n is based on Android's native VPNService. It builds a tun virtual network card through VPNService and communicates with supernode and edges.
- tun2tap
> Android only supports tun virtual network card, only support network layer, and n2n  requires tap virtual network card, which needs data link layer support. So we simulated the data link layer and ARP protocol.
- n2n protocol
> Hin2n supports the n2n protocol by using the native method of jni to reuse the code of the original n2n project as far as possible.

## N2N protocol version
There are three popular versions of the n2n project
- Version v1 developed by the great masters of ntop.org. Project address：https://github.com/meyerd/n2n.git(n2n_v1)
- Version v2 developed by the great masters of ntop.org. Project address：https://github.com/ntop/n2n.git
- Version [v2s](#about-v2s-version) developed by the master Meyerd. Project address：https://github.com/meyerd/n2n.git(n2n_v2)

Only the ntop v2 protocol is under active development.

### About v2s version
The v2s is the renaming of the v2 (also known as v2.1) developed by master Meyerd in the QQ group(5804301), that is, the v2 upgrade version. The v2s version is not compatible with the v2 version developed by the ntop.org masters. To avoid confusion, the QQ group friends named the project separately.

## Development and compilation
### Project Structure
The n2n source code is linked to the hin2n directory via git submodules, which are located into the `bundles` directory. hin2n provides the [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/switch-iot/hin2n/blob/dev_android/Hin2n_android/app/CMakeLists.txt) file to build all the supported n2n versions from the corresponding submodule. The submodules actually link a fork of the official n2n source code repositories (e.g. https://github.com/switch-iot/n2n_ntop) in order to guaranteed that the compilation of hin2n always succedes. The ntop v2 fork is a 1:1 copy of the official repository, which will be periodically updated to reflect the upstream changes.

### Hin2n
- `git clone https://github.com/switch-iot/hin2n.git --recurse-submodules`
- Hin2n_android directory is the Hin2n project Android source directory
- Execute `gradlew assemble` in Hin2n_android directory to compile Hin2n. If you are using Android Studio, use "Import Project", then select the `Hin2n_android` directory and build the `app` module.
- When switching branches, you need to execute `git submodule update` to synchronize the code of the submodules

### Windows environment
The git compatible symbolic link needs to be set in the Windows environment.
- Launch `gpedit.msc`, and add the account(s) to `Computer Configuration/Windows Setting/Security Settings/Local Policies/User Rights Assignment/Create symbolic links`
- Or run git-cmd as an administrator user, and execute the following command
- git clone -c `core.symlinks=true` https://github.com/switch-iot/hin2n.git `--recurse-submodules`  && cd hin2n && `link.bat`

### About open source agreement
The project is open sourced under the [`GPLv3`](LICENSE) agreement, and is consistent with the original open source agreement of n2n. We also hope that everyone will support and comply with the open source agreement of this project.
